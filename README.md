# The Mockup
This serves to illustrate the formal and conceptual considerations made for the way the carat and color meters could represent the data. I have placed the sample charts inside the basic layout in various ways and along side other key elements that will feature in the final, interactive map. 

# The Charts
The more traditional looking chart an the top of the page works well as a stand-alone, static bar chart, and closely matches my original design proposal. However, the chart below it takes things much further in the direction of the low-resolution computer imaging effect that I also want to touch on. 

I really like the idea of the data itself being "invisible" in a way that recalls some type of sonar, ultraviolet, or other navigational imaging technology designed to chart things underwater - or underground in this case, which makes this style especially appealing.
